PROJECT NAME : command line calculator (bc)

USAGE : ./calc [ -option]

OPTIONS :
		Option		Description
		-l    		trigonometric, log, ln and e^(expression) options
		-h    		help and exit
		--help		help and exit
		
DESCRIPTION :
		This code can perform operaions in which final answer has less than 
  	     30 digits before decimal point. calc reads from the standard input. A-
  	     ll code is executed as it is read.
  	     
  	     Following operations can be performed by this program :
  	     
  	     addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*),division(/), modulus(5)
  	     ,exponent(^), equalto(==), greater than(>), greater than equal to(>=),
  	     smaller than(<), smaller than equal to(>=),
  	     
  	     logical AND(&&), logical OR(||), logical NOT(!) 
  	     
  	     sine, cosine, tan, sec, cosec, cot, log(base 10), ln(natural logarithm
  	     base 'e'), e^(expression), cuberoot, squareroot 
  	     
  	     
  	     Precedence of operations is as follows :
  	     
  	     sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec, cot, sqrt, cbrt,base change		max
  	     *, /, %, ^							        avg
  	     +, -							       less
  	     &&, ||, !, >, <, >=, <=, ==					min

	     
	     syntax for base change operations :
	     
	     binary to decimal			bd(expression)
	     binary to octal			bo(expression)
	     binary to hex			bh(expression)
	     octal to binary			ob(expression)
	     octal to decimal			od(expression)
	     octal to hex			oh(expression)
	     decimal to binary			db(expression)
	     decimal to octal			do(expression)
	     decimal to hex			dh(expression)
	     hex to binary			hb(expression)
	     hex to octal			ho(expression)
	     hex to decimal			hd(expression)
