DESCRIPTION :
		This is a command line calculator which supports arbitrary precisi-
	     on numbers. One expression can have at the most 128 operaotors and 128 
	     operands. It reads from the standard input. All operations are execut-
	     ed according to their precedence.
  	     
  	     Following operations can be performed by this program :
  	     
  	     addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*),division(/), modulus(%)
  	     ,exponent(^), equalto(==), greater than(>), greater than equal to(>=),
  	     smaller than(<), smaller than equal to(>=),
  	     
  	     logical AND(&&), logical OR(||), logical NOT(!) 
  	     
  	     sine, cosine, tan, sec, cosec, cot, log(base 10), ln(natural logarithm
  	     base 'e'), e^(expression), cuberoot, squareroot 
  	     
  	     ++(pre), --(pre), +=, -=, *=, /=
  	     
  	     Precedence of operations is as follows :
  	     
  	     sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec, cot, sqrt, cbrt,base change		max
  	     *, /, %, ^							        avg
  	     +, -							       less
  	     &&, ||, !, >, <, >=, <=, ==					min

	        Operations like sine, cos, tan, log, e^ etc. can be performed in -l
	     mode only.
	     
	     syntax for base change operations :
	     
	     binary to decimal			bd(expression)
	     binary to octal			bo(expression)
	     binary to hex			bh(expression)
	     octal to binary			ob(expression)
	     octal to decimal			od(expression)
	     octal to hex			oh(expression)
	     decimal to binary			db(expression)
	     decimal to octal			do(expression)
	     decimal to hex			dh(expression)
	     hex to binary			hb(expression)
	     hex to octal			ho(expression)
	     hex to decimal			hd(expression)
	     
	       It can handle variables too. Variable name must be a single character.
	     Small letters from 'a' to 'z' and capital letters from 'G'  to  'Z'  are 
	     allowed to be used as variables. Alpabets from 'A' to 'F' are not allow-
	     d as they are used as digits in hexagecimal numbers. Default  values  of
	     variables are set to zero.
	     (code of ++, -- is not written yet)
